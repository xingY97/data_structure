CS 1.3: Core Data Structures & Algorithms
Course Description
This course explores the foundations of computer science including discrete mathematics, abstract data types, data structures, and algorithm analysis and design. Students will compare and contrast iterative and recursive algorithms to analyze design and performance tradeoffs. Students will implement and test data structures including lists, stacks, queues, sets, maps, and trees. Students will then apply these to real-world problems like phone call routing to understand their tradeoffs. Students will also write technical blog articles about these topics to deepen understanding, improve technical writing, and bolster their online presence as knowledgeable and proficient software engineers.

Why you should know this
Data structures are the building blocks of computer science. It's the foundation that allows engineers to store and manipulate data. Once you have a place to store the data, if you need to find data or sort it in a specific way, you'll need search algorithms in order to do that.

Implementations of these concepts are how some of the largest tech companies in the world were built. Displaying relevant search results and finding friends and peers on social networks would be impossible without these core concepts. They're also the most common topics for software engineering interviews, and leveling up your knowledge on these topics is required to nail that technical interview!

CS 1.2: How Data Structures Work
Learning Outcomes
By the end of this course, students will be able to:

Implement, compare and contrast iterative and recursive algorithms
Analyze best-case and worst-case time and space complexity of an algorithm
Implement several abstract data types and data structures including linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, maps, sets, and binary search trees
Implement tree traversal algorithms: depth-first and breadth-first ordering
Write technical articles to deepen understanding and demonstrate mastery
Assignments
Piazza
This term we will be using Piazza for class discussion. The system is highly catered to getting you help fast and efficiently from classmates, the TA, and myself. Rather than emailing questions to the teaching staff, I encourage you to post your questions on Piazza. If you have any problems or feedback for the developers, email team@piazza.com.

Coding Challenges
Each lesson has an associated set of coding challenges with starter code and unit tests provided. Full details can be found in the "Challenges" section of each lesson linked in the schedule above. You will submit each coding challenge on Gradescope in its own repo and also submit a video demoing your completed code.

Technical Article
Students will also write a technical article about a topic related to course content to deepen their understanding, improve their technical writing skills, and demonstrate mastery of computer science, which will bolster their online presence as knowledgeable and proficient software engineers. Refer to the technical article guidelines for more information about article requirements and detailed tips on how to select a topic related to computer science, research the topic, create an outline, write your article, cite all sources of borrowed material, and provide feedback to other students.

Evaluation
To pass this course you must meet the following requirements:

Complete all required assignments
Pass all assignments according to the associated assignment rubric
Pass all quizzes with a score 70% or higher
If an assignment or quiz is not passing you will have up to a week after your grade is received to retake and bring your score up to passing
Actively participate in class and abide by the attendance policy
Your participation in in-class activities will be a part of your overall grade, each time your participate in the majority of day's activities you will earn a point, you must earn at least 12/14 activity participation points to pass this class
